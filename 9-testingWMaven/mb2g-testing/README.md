#testing Java with Maven Spock  Examples
created pom2, groovy dependencie updated to version 3. This fixes the reflection problem and test ng.
Since groovy updated spock needs to be updated to run with version 3 as well. 
In build groovy has to be version 3 as well.
One test passed succesfully should be 2. 
Original pom still has warnings and test ng, but is running both tests.
Wil use that one till pom2 has been resolved.
